# Bookify

## Summary

I've always been a huge fan on marketplace platforms (uber, lyft, airbnb, rover, etc.), but especially those geared towards travel. Hotels are waay too expensive.
Bookify is an app similar to airbnb or vrboâ€” users can either book a stay at a hosts home, or list their own home to host guests.
